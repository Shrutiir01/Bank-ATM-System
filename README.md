# Bank-ATM-System
Bank ATM System project is to simulate core ATM operations using SQL and PL/SQL. It is designed to demonstrate:
1. Simulate ATM Functionality
Allow basic banking operations such as:
•	Withdraw
•	Deposit
•	Balance Inquiry
•	Mini Statement
2. Secure Transactions
•	Authenticate users via PIN.
•	Prevent overdrafts and invalid access using triggers and validations.
3. Track All Transactions
•	Record each transaction with type, amount, and timestamp.
4. Implement Data Integrity & Business Logic
•	Use procedures, functions, and triggers to enforce rules and automate processes.
5. Detect Suspicious Activity
•	Monitor unusual behavior (e.g., multiple withdrawals in a day).
•	Log such actions for review using a TriggerLog table.
6. Technologies Used:
•	SQL: For table, sequence, and data creation.
•	PL/SQL: For business logic using procedures, functions, and triggers.
